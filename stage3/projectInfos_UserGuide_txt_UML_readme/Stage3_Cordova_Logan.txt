Stage 3:
Logan Cordova

For stage 3 I expanded my original 3 classes: 
* Movie 
* Showtime 
* Screen class
 to include a SeatingArrangement class, MovieManager class, ShowtimeManager class, and Customer class; providing the original code for each of these classes.
I was tasked with commenting and editing the format of each class file within the repository and finished a majority of the user guide. 
(I survived! Whoo!!)
